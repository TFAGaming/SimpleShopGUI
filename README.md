## How to install
Go to the [releases section](https://github.com/TFAGaming/SimpleShopGUI/releases), scroll down to find the version you want to use, click on **Assets** and then click on the **.jar** file.

After the download completes, simply copy the **.jar** file and navigate to the plugins folder within your Minecraft server directory, and paste the file there. If your Minecraft server is currently running, you can use the command `/reload` to activate the plugin. However, for optimal performance, we advise stopping the server and then restarting it for a clean startup.
